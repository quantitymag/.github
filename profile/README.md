# QUANTITY MAGAZINE

### A monthly webmag celebrating the *practice of art* in all its slipshod glory.

We feature random one-offs, experiments and explorations, and works-in-progress from a chaotic group of professionals, amateurs, and enthusiasts. We run media of all types: Music, visual art, fiction, non-fiction, video, audio, screenplays, etc. etc.



## Submissions

We have a few file-format restrictions for audio-visual items, but it's nothing unusual. We'll let you know.

## Editors

Quantity mag is run by Molly Bolten (LA), Devin Smith (SF), and Mark Pascucci-Clifford (Oakland).
